jQuery Konami plugin
====================

Yet another jQuery Konami plugin!

There are plenty of jQuery Konami plugins out there, but I couldn't find one that I liked (in terms of complexity or efficiency/overhead). So I created my own.

Small, simple, low overhead.

Usage
-----

```javascript
$(window).konami(function() {
	alert('You did the Konami!').
})
```

Now, press `up`, `up`, `down`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `left`, `right`, `b`, `a` and be alerted.
